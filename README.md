# Matrix determinant calculator

Rather simple calculator of a matrix calculator written in C++11. 

This project uses boost multiprecision library for calculations so if you want to build it you will need boost libraries (tested with version 1.65.1), or you can just change the typedef in ```Matrix.h``` to anything you prefer.

The calculator contains no optimizations of the calculation however the implemented gauss elimination should work with any matrix.
